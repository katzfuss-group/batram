# batram

This branch hosts a Pyton implementation of the methodology presented in 
[Calle-Saldarriaga et al. (2025+)]. 

Please refer to the [main branch](https://github.com/katzfuss-group/batram) for
related research projects.

## Installation

Run the following command in your local virtual environment. Please make sure
that a c++ compiler and the python headers are installed since this is needed to
install the dependecy [veccs](https://github.com/katzfuss-group/veccs).

1. `pip install -e .`

## Getting Started

For a quick introduction to the package, see the [getting-started notebook](notebooks/tutorial-mf.ipynb) in the `notebooks` folder. It covers
key topics such as data preprocessing, model fitting, model evaluation, and
posterior sampling.

## Acknowledgements

[implementation](https://github.com/katzfuss-group/BaTraMaSpa_py) was provided
