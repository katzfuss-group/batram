This branch implementes the method describe in 'Bayesian nonparametric
generative modeling of large multivariate non-Gaussian spatial fields' [Wiemann
and Katzfuss (2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13253-023-00580-z). 

Please note that the multivatiate method will be integrated with the main
development branch in the future.
