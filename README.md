Bayesian Transport Maps for non-Gaussian spatial fields. The package contains a
python implementation of the method described in [Katzfuss and Sch√§fer
(2023)](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2023.2197158).

## Installation

Run the following command in your local virtual environment. Please make sure
that a c++ compiler and the python headers are installed since this is needed to
install the dependecy [veccs](https://github.com/katzfuss-group/veccs).

1. `pip install -e .`

### Remarks

- We have observed that the software seems to be unstable on a MacBook Pro with
  M1 chip when using conda instead of a regular python installation.


## How to contribute?

1. install the package with the additional dependencies for development using
   `pip install -e .[dev,docs]`
2. before pushing on `main` or a PR, run `pre-commit run --all-files` and
   `pytest`.
3. before pushing on `main` or merging a PR, make sure the code is well
   documented and covered by tests.

The documentenation can be viewed while editing the code using `mkdocs serve`.
